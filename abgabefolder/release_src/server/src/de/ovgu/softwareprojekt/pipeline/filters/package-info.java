/**
 * This package contains all filters written for the framework. You may use them yourself. The easiest way to create your
 * own filter is to subclass {@link de.ovgu.softwareprojekt.pipeline.filters.AbstractFilter}, as it implements some
 * interface functions you probably don't need, and forces you to implement those that are needed.
